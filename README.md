# hello-world
My first repository, including the first projects I've worked on

At the creation of this repository I'd be studying my M. Sc. in Data Analytics and Decision Science at the RWTH Aachen Business School in Aachen, Germany. I'm still on the Data Analyst stage of my path, so don't expect the most advanced stuff yet. Hopefully, this repository will show my gradual progression into becoming a full-fledged Data Scientist!
